The challenge is to produce images that are convincingly real, as judged by pre-trained neural networks. Dogs are the best and in case, we're using them in this project because of their diverse range in breeds, colors, and sizes. All of these elements make them pretty good subjects for image generation.\n\nGANS have so many different applications and can be used in all kinds of industries where we want to replicate data. For this project, I'm going to be playing around to make realistic dog images. This is an example of deep learning that I would like to gain more knowledge about.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This dataset originates from a Kaggle competition focused on generative dog images.
